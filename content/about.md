I was born in 1990, ancestral home is the southern Jiangsu province. A pseudo literary and artistic youth.

I graduated from college in 2012, major is [**Information and Computing Science**](http://slxy.xzit.edu.cn).

However what I learned was not what I used.

After I did a year of wiring customer service and a year of factory apprentice. I switched to **Internet** in 2014.
